## Motivation

In this pandemic situation, our aim is to help researchers to find out a solution. In order to do that we are aiming to provide them with proper datasets that makes the process easier. A [repository](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) to build a public open dataset of chest X-ray and CT images of patients which are positive or suspected of COVID-19 or other viral and bacterial pneumonias (MERS, SARS, and ARDS.) was created by [Joseph Paul Cohen](https://github.com/ieee8023). Data have been collected from public sources as well as through indirect collection from hospitals and physicians.

We are providing lung bounding boxes of those publicly available datasets. Each image was manually annotated by our radiologist. We are releasing lung bounding boxes dataset.

## Who are we

We are **General Blockchain Inc**, an AI based company creating Human-Machine Artificial Intelligence.

Our vision is to build a programmable Human-Based Artificial Intelligence, able to solve problems that neither humans nor computers can solve alone. The first application of this technology is a full-stack Computer Vision product which collects, annotates and creates datasets which allow AI to recognize any objects in unseen images or videos.
