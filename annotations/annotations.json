The brightness of both lungs was decreased and multiple patchy shadows were observed; edges were blurred, and large ground-glass opacity and condensation shadows were mainly on the lower right lobe. Tracheal intubation could be seen in the trachea. Heart shadow roughly presents in the normal range. On the left side, the diaphragmatic surface is not clearly displayed. The right side of the diaphragmatic surface was light and smooth and rib phrenic angle was less sharp. Chest x-ray on Jan 10 showed worse status (2B)"

Afebrile, hypoxic and tachycardic in the field, arrived to ED on non-rebreather satting well but altered and in respiratory distress, intubated for airway protection. CBC/BMP completely unremarkable aside from anion gap of 19 and leukocytosis 16. CXR (image 1) showed some questionable linear opacities compared to recent prior, and there was concern for infection given #COVID-19 epidemic and respiratory distress. However further labs revealed POC trop 2.16, BNP 4K, VBG pH 7.37, lactate 4.3. EKG showed new RBBB and S1Q3T3 pattern (image 2, right). Echo (image 2, left) showed severely dilated RV, apical hypokinesis and McConnell's sign. PERT code was activated and pt was taken for stat CTA (image 3) revealing massive #Pulmonaryembolism (?saddle) but predominately occluding the entire R side. Systemic thrombolysis was considered, however, pt had known meningioma, which showed interval growth on stat CT head, raising concern for bleed. Within 4h of presentation, pt was taken to IR suite for embolectomy, which was successful at restoring flow to entire R lung field (image 4). Involvement of L pulmonary artery was non-occlusive and not intervened on. After the procedure, pt was taken for LE dopplers (image 5), which identified residual clot burden in the L profunda femoral vein. The following day, pt was extubated to room air and made a full recovery.",

A whole body CT was performed to look for sources of infection and lymphadenopathy. A mid and lower zone diffuse ground glass pattern was seen, with admixed areas of interlobular septal thickening, giving a \"crazy paving\" pattern. Some small cystic spaces were observed too.

The X-ray investigation demonstrates a widespread increase in the peribroncovascular interstitial texture with associated bilateral bilateral parenchymal thickenings arranged in the peripheral location. Pleural effusion on the right with obliteration of the costophrenic sinus on this side. The Pz is assisted and treated in an MU (department dedicated to COVID-19 patients) and after about 1 week it shows significant improvements as evident from the first control CT performed about 8 days after hospitalization.",

Chest radiograph is generally nonspecific manifesting with peripheral and basal predominant consolidation. The most common imaging appearance on chest CT scans include peripheral and basal predominant ground-glass opacities and less commonly consolidation that often has a rounded appearance. Some of the opacities may manifest an atoll or reverse halo sign with central ground-glass opacities and peripheral consolidation. A perilobular distribution may also be present, likely representing an organizing pneumonia pattern of lung injury. AP chest radiograph at presentation shows peripheral and basal predominant consolidation."

Little more than 24 hours from the previous x-ray the patient has increased work of breathing, fatigue and low oxygen saturations on 10-15 L/min of supplemental oxygen. Progressive acute respiratory failure. Patient intubated and mechanically ventilated. The endotracheal tube is just above the carina and there is a nasogastric tube within the stomach. There is a right jugular central line with the tip in the superior vena cava. There is now widespread interstitial and alveolar opacity diffusely spread through both lung fields.",

Apart from pre-existing arterial hypertension, there were no risk factors or known pathogen exposure. Blood analysis showed normal leucocytes, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (106.3mg/l; normal range <5mg/l) and a normal procalcitonin level (0.12?g/l; normal range <0.50?g/l). Glomerular filtration rate was reduced (47ml/min). Reverse transcription polymerase change reaction (RT-PCR) for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was positive, Influenza tests were negative. As dyspnoea deteriorated, the patient was admitted to our intensive care unit. Under continuous invasive ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotics CRP levels rose to 300mg/l and fever continued over the next 4 days. With the impending need of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a chest CT scan was performed. Chest X-ray at initial presentation showed bilateral pulmonary consolidation in mid-and lower zones (Figs. 1a and b).",

She was tachypneic (30bpm), with lymphopenia and low oxygen saturation (SpO2 85%, PAFI<250). Patient presented to the emergency department two days earlier with fever (up to 38.6?C), dry cough, odynophagia and general malaise. She was discharged from hospital because she did not present alarm criteria at that time. The patient required mechanical ventilation and was admitted to intensive care. During her stay in ICU, poor evolution to respiratory distress syndrome and to multi-organic failure. The patient passed away 24 hours later. Figure 5 (Day 3). Bilateral alveolar consolidation with panlobar affectation, with typical radiological findings of ARDS. 24 hours later the patient passed away."

        "clinical_notes": "A 63-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer and recurrent malignant pleural effusion came to our institutional ER with fever (39 ?C) and dyspnea at rest. Being our institute located in a severely involved area of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical symptoms were compatible with COVID-19 infection. Laboratory parameters included hemoglobin 10.7, white blood cells 3.98, C-reactive protein 43.5, arterial pH 7.5, pO2 53 mmHg, pCO2 31 mmHg and blood lactate concentration 1 mmol/L. Although the patient underwent a right pleurodesis 6 months ago, chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion (loculated on the right side) as well as interstitial thickening (Fig. 1A), a common imaging feature in COVID-19. She underwent a naso-/oropharyngeal swab which turned positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after being processed through a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Novel Coronavirus PCR Fluorescence Diagnostic Kit, BioGerm Medical Biotechnology). She started as an inpatient with 1 week of non-invasive assisted ventilation that reduced fever, clinical symptoms and normalized inflammatory laboratory values such as C-reactive protein. Still, respiratory function and blood oxygen levels remained poor despite an increase in FiO2 from 60 to 70%. Consequently, percutaneous drainage was requested with the aim of improving ventilation and blood oxygen saturation. The procedure was performed at the bedside in an isolated ward dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The operator wore an FFp2 mask, double gloves, protective glasses and a surgical gown (Fig. 2). After local anesthesia, two 8F multi-hole drainages were inserted bilaterally using dedicated US equipment in the isolated ward as image guidance. The procedure lasted approximately 1 h and was well tolerated. Around 1800 mL was drained in the next 5 h from both sides. All disposable equipment and devices were then immediately discarded in specific containers. Post-procedural chest X-rays showed a marked increase in the ventilated parenchyma. Along with clinical symptoms, also laboratory markers rapidly improved and blood saturation levels reached the normal range (SpO2 98%). The patient switched from assisted ventilation to a simple face mask (2 L/min O2) and maintained normal peripheral capillary oxygen saturation. At the time of writing, she is alive and close to hospital discharge. A Chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusion and diffuse interstitial thickening.

On arrival to the ED, vital signs were temperature 37.3 ?C, heart rate 96 beats per minute, blood pressure 137/70, 20 respirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Lung examination was notable for non-labored respirations with clear breath sounds bilaterally. The reminder of his physical examination was unremarkable. The ED treatment team pursued imaging to rule out a mediastinal mass in the setting of persistent hiccups and weight loss. A chest X-ray showed new groundglass opacities in the right upper lung, left mid and lower lungs, and right costophrenic angle"

        "clinical_notes": "The patient was a 74-year-old man with a body weight of 65 kg and had no overseas travel history and no contact with COVID-19 patients. He was a hepatitis B carrier and had hypertension, bronchial asthma, and was not under a medical treatment. He experienced slight fever on Day 1 and was admitted to a nearby hospital on Day 4 with prolonged high fever (> 39 ?C) and shortness of breath. The Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test revealed poorly controlled diabetes with a value of 9.4%. The PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, and he was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Day 7. He received intensive drug treatment, including ciclesonide, lopinavir/ritonavir and systemic corticosteroids, as well as respiratory care. Despite these treatments, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and he underwent tracheal intubation (23 cm deep from the mouth) for mechanical ventilation on Day 11. After his transfer to our hospital on Day 12, favipiravir was added to the drug regimen to improve the general condition. However, the patient's condition did not improve despite these intensive treatments. Because of the prolonged tracheal intubation, a tracheostomy was performed after consultation with the anesthesiologists, medical staff in the intensive care unit (ICU), and the infection prevention and control team. Surgical tracheostomy was performed on Day 28 in a negative-pressure airborne infection isolation room in our ICU. Fig. 1 shows the patient's clinical course and chest radiological findings before tracheostomy was performed. After the tracheostomy, his respiratory condition improved by Day 35, and thus he was considered for transfer to the other hospital."

        "clinical_notes": "80 year-old-female with a history of hypertension was brought to the ED for a chief complaint of altered mental status and left-sided weakness. The family denied history of fever or cough, but reported that the patient has been falling frequently in the past week. The patient was intubated for airway protection and a code stroke was activated. Vital signs in the ED were significant for Temp of 100.2? F (37.9? C), HR 101, BP 130/77, Examination was significant for left hemiplegia and aphasia. NIHSS was calculated to be 36. CT head revealed an acute right MCA stroke (Fig. 3a). CTA of the head and neck demonstrated occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at origin and incidental bilateral patchy apical lung opacities (Fig. 3b). CT perfusion demonstrated a 305 cc core infarct in the right MCA distribution and a surrounding 109 cc ischemic penumbra (Fig. 3c). The patient was deemed not a suitable candidate for any acute neuro-intervention due to the large core infarct. Considering these characteristic CT findings, the patient was tested for COVID-19 infection with PCR and was positive. Laboratory data on admission demonstrated leukocytosis with lymphopenia, elevated d-dimer (13966 ng/ml DDU), along with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (712 U/L) and elevated C ? reactive protein (16.24 mg/dl). The patient?s hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury and progressively increasing oxygen requirements. On the third day of admission, her family chose for terminal extubation with comfort measures. Fig. 2b. CXR demonstrating worsening bilateral opacities."

Chest radiograph showed bilateral, patchy, ill-defined lung infiltrates (Figure 1B). Throat swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (Corman et al., 2020). He progressively became more dependent on supplemental oxygen (Figure 1A), with worsening lung infiltrates on chest radiograph. His respiratory function reached a nadir on day 5 post illness onset, as evidenced by the oxygen saturation (Figure 1C) and tachycardia (Figure 1D) despite 4L of supplemental oxygen. He was initiated on oral lopinavir-ritonavir on the same day. After the first two positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR findings, subsequent throat swabs from Case 1 were only positive intermittently until day 18 of illness (Figure 1A).",

        "clinical_notes": "Patient #1 is a 71-year-old Caucasian male, who was admitted in the hospital for critical limb ischemia of the right leg requiring surgery. He had a meaningful past medical history, due to history of atrial fibrillation (resolved at the time of hospitalization), hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, associated with multiple arterial complications and mild kidney failure. Indeed, the patient had coronary artery disease requiring 5 stents, and then the recent peripheral arterial disease treated with embolectomy by Fogarty catheter. During the hospitalization, on April 6th the patient was diagnosed with bilateral interstitial pneumonia (see chest X-ray, Fig. 1 ), that was eventually demonstrated to have been caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of severe hypoxia irrespective of oxygen support through standard Ventimask, the patient had to start non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) with Continuous Positive Air-Pressure (C-PAP) with 60% of Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FIO2) given in 2?h?cycles every 12?h. At this time, his arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and his blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) were 65?mmHg and 93%, respectively; the patient had increased C-reactive protein (CRP, 63?mg/l), increased lactate de-hydrogenase (LDH, 466 UI/L), leukocytosis (16.9?g/L) and lymphocytopenia. Patient's performance status (PS, using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] scale) was 3. In consideration of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2, the patient was considered a candidate for experimental treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including the complement C3 inhibitor AMY-101, available at the San Raffaele Hospital. AMY-101 is available at the San Raffaele Hospital within a compassionate use program sponsored by Amyndas Pharmaceuticals S.A, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of San Raffaele Hospital on March 25th. On April 8th, the AMY-101 compassionate use was discussed with the patient, who expressed his willingness to be included in the program. After having signed the IRB approved informed consent, the patient was enrolled in the AMY-101 compassionate use program. The patient was not treated with specific antiviral therapy, whereas antibacterial prophylaxis with piperacilline/tazobactam was added 2?days before the start of AMY-101 administration and continued for the entire treatment period. April 10th was the day that the AMY-101 treatment started; at baseline, the patient was in poor general clinical conditions, with severe fatigue, severe tachypnea (>35 respiratory acts per minute), and persistent dry cough. Pulmonary auscultation revealed mid-inspiratory and expiratory coarse crackles, bilateral. He was in severe ARDS, requiring C-PAP cycles (2?h every 12?h) alternating to oxygen support through Ventimask with 60% FIO2. His lung parameters at baseline, with FIO2 60%, were as follows: PaO2 89?mmHg, PaCO2 36?mmHg, SpO2 96%, pH?7,5, PaO2/FIO2 148?mmHg. Blood tests were as follows: white blood cells (WBC) 11.6???109/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 8.6???109/L, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) 1.6???109/L, CRP 94.2?mg/l, LDH 306 UI/l, C3 plasma level 1.81?g/L. Additional lab testing demonstrated mild renal function impairment and grade I transaminase elevation. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score were 15 and 1 (for respiratory rate?>?22/min), respectively. AMY-101 was given intravenously (IV) through a peripheral vein infusion at dose of 5?mg/kg?mg/Kg/day, given as initial loading dose administered in 6?h; no side effects were recorded after the loading dose. Immediately after the completion of the loading dose, 13 maintenance doses were administered as 24-h continuous infusions, for a 14-day treatment period. No infusion reactions were reported during the whole duration of the therapy; notably, the experimental treatment did not worsen renal and hepatic function. After 48?h from the initiation of AMY-101 treatment, the patient showed a dramatic improvement of all parameters that were abnormal at baseline, resulting in the quick resolution of the broad inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. In particular, CRP and LDH progressively normalized, while leukocytosis and lymphocytopenia improved more slowly but progressively (Fig. 2 ). These laboratory findings were associated with a significant improvement of respiratory performance with a gradual decrease of oxygen requirement (Fig. 3 ). Starting from April 18th (Day 9) a progressive weaning from oxygen supplementation was allowed. C-PAP was initially reduced to alternate day cycles, and then discontinued on April 20th (Day 11 of AMY 101 treatment). Similarly to the progressive and continuous improvement of blood tests, the lung function also continued to improve: indeed, the day after C-PAP discontinuation the patient's oxygen requirement diminished, with FIO2 reducing from 40% to 31% and then 28%, without desaturation (Fig. 3). Interestingly, lung functional improvement was not associated with major changes by imaging: indeed, the bilateral interstitial pneumonia was still observed by a chest X-ray performed on April 16th (Day 7), and by a subsequent CT scan performed on April 20th (Day 11), that showed also a mild right pleural effusion. Chest X-ray at enrollment. The X-ray demonstrates the bilateral infiltration of the lungs leading to the diagnosis of bilateral interstitial pneumonia.",

        "clinical_notes": "We report on a 59-year-old woman 13 months after bilateral lung transplantation who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection. She underwent bilateral lung transplantation because of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in February 2019. Alemtuzumab was administered as induction therapy, and a dual immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus and prednisolone was used as maintenance therapy. Following a complicated post-transplant course, she was discharged 3 months post-operatively. The highest forced expiratory volume at 1 second value was reached in December 2019 with 1.60 liters (72% predicted). On the day of hospitalization (Day 0), she presented to the outpatient clinic for a routine follow-up visit with no apparent symptoms. Lung function testing showed a drop in forced expiratory volume at 1 second to 1.28 liters (57% predicted). Upon questioning, she expressed mild exercise dyspnea and a dry cough but no fever or diarrhea. The patient had no concerning travel history. Immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus 0.6 mg twice daily (trough level was 5?7 ng/dl owing to alemtuzumab induction and history of osteomyelitis), and 5 mg prednisolone daily. Leukocyte count was 11,360 cells/?l (6% lymphocytes), C-reactive protein was 1.0 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase was 297 units/liter, and creatine kinase was 32 units/liter. There was no thrombocytopenia. Arterial blood had a partial pressure of oxygen of 55 mm Hg without supplementation. Real-time reverse transcriptase?PCR (RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 from Altona Diagnostics) of nasal and pharyngeal swabs showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, thereby establishing a diagnosis of COVID-19. She was hospitalized, and a chest X-ray showed chronic post-operative dystelectasis on the left side with some increase in density (Figure 1 ) compared with December 2019. A chest computerized tomography scan showed ground glass opacities mainly in the left lower lobe with left-sided parenchymal consolidation or partial atelectasis (Figure 2 ). Oxygen supplementation with 1 to 2 liters/minute was administered. Antibacterial therapy was empirically started based on suspected bacterial superinfection. Otherwise, no major changes in medication were performed. A detailed medication plan is shown in Table 1 . She remained asymptomatic and remained stable. RT-PCR testing was performed on a weekly basis and remained positive on Day 7 and Day 14. Cycle threshold levels of SARS-CoV-2 E- and S-gene are provided in Table 2 . Cycle threshold values increased at every sample time point, indicating a decrease in virus levels over time. On nasopharyngeal swabs on Day 21, no SARS-CoV-2-RNA could be detected by RT-PCR. No oxygen was required from Day 17 until discharge. The patient was discharged home on Day 21. Figure 1. Chest X-ray at admission showing chronic post-operative dystelectasis with minor increase in density on the left side.",

During the procedure he developed an intense vagal reaction with drop in blood pressure to 60/40 mm Hg with presyncope and diaphoresis, which resolved after fluid challenge. TTE ruled out pericardial effusion. Chest radiograph was within normal limits (Figure 3A). He was discharged home asymptomatic the following day."

        "clinical_notes": "A 78-year-old woman, a non-smoker with dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism presented to her primary care physician on 13 February with general malaise and anorexia lasting several days. She did not have other symptoms, such as fever, cough, sputum, or dyspnoea. She had visited Paris, France, from 30 January to 4 February 2020. At that time, her vital signs were within normal limits, including SpO2 (i.e., 98 % on room air) (Fig. 1A). On 18 February, she complained of cough and exacerbation of malaise and anorexia and had an associated 3 kg body weight loss. She was referred to our hospital because of a bilateral reticular shadow seen on chest X-rays (Fig. 1B) and ground-glass opacity (GGO) adjacent to the pleura seen on chest computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 1C, D). At the time of her visit, she had a temperature of 37.7 ?C; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; heart rate, 106 beats/min (regular); blood pressure, 139/63 mmHg; and SPO2 of 95 % on room air. Admission blood tests showed elevated C-reactive protein (7.9 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (106 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (80 U/L), ?-glutamyltransferase (153 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (372 U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (383 U/L). Other blood test results were within the normal range. COVID-19 was suggested based on her prolonged clinical symptoms, travel history, and chest X-ray and CT findings. We thus performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of a sputum specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection. A rapid influenza test, conducted simultaneously, was positive for influenza A virus, and she was started on oseltamivir with ceftriaxone 2 g/day and azithromycin 500 mg/day to cover possible bacterial infections. One day after oseltamivir initiation, on 19 February, she became afebrile. The PCR assay performed on admission tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 20 February. By 21 February, her general malaise had worsened. Chest X-ray (Fig. 1E) and CT (Fig. 1F, G), re-examined on 25 February, showed improvements in previously noted GGO, appearing more like a consolidation. Given the improvement in her clinical symptoms and CT findings, another PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed on 26 February which tested still positive. Subsequent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing on 1 and 2 March tested negative, and the patient was discharged on 5 March. Chest X-ray (Fig. 1H) and CT (Fig. 1I, J) images obtained a day before discharge showed improvements of previously noted consolidation and GGO. She did not require oxygen therapy throughout her hospital stay."

        "clinical_notes": "A 54-year old man presented to the emergency department of Erfan Niyayesh Hospital, Tehran, Iran, with complains of high-grade fever, cough, and dyspnea for five days. At admission time, he had fever up to 38 ?C. Peripheral oxygen saturation was 90% with a face mask. No abnormality was seen in laboratory results except positive C-reactive protein, lymphopenia with 570 cells/?L, and severe respiratory acidosis. The chest X-ray imaging revealed bilateral infiltration in both upper and lower lobs (Fig. 1a). The patient had no underlying diseases and history of medicine usage. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sample for COVID-19 was reported positive and according to RT-PCR test and clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was made for the patient. The therapeutic regimen included Hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 200 mg P.O. BID and lopinavir/ritonavir at a dose of 200/50 mg P.O. BID initiated for the patient. After four days, the clinical condition of the patient was deteriorated and he was subjected to intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. The peripheral oxygen saturation decreased to 82%. The chest X-ray imaging showed the progressive infiltration (Fig. 1b) and the patient was categorized as a critically COVID-19 case with remarkable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The plasma level of interlukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured at this time. The results showed high levels of inflammatory cytokines. The urine output also decreased to 200 mL during the last 12 h and creatinine increased to 1.5 mg/dL. At this time, it is decided to start continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT, Prismaflex, Baxter, IL, USA) with disposable hemoperfusion cartridge (HA 380 cartridge, Jafron Biomedical Co., China) due to cytokine release storm and hypoxemia. A Shaldon catheter was inserted and CRRT was done for three sessions. The CRRT modality was continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The replacement fluid volume was removed by 35 mL/kg/h and the pump circulated blood by 250 mL/min. Priming of hemoperfusion was done with saline, and the cartridge was primed in a vertical position with the arterial side facing downward. A bolus dose of 2500 IU of heparin was administered into the arterial line, the cartridge was kept inlet side down, and blood flow through the cartridge was begun. Totally, 6000 IU was needed through the procedure. CRRT was started with a high ultrafiltration rate (200 mL/h). Each cartridge was replaced with a new cartridge after 6 h. The fluid removal rate was decreased to 50 mL/h after 8 h and then to zero mL/h during the last 8 h in the first 24 h. The second and the third sessions of CRRT were conducted by 0 mL/h fluid removal. A 24-h rest between sessions, was considered to avoid the probable coagulopathy and electrolyte abnormality. After three sessions of CRRT plus hemopurification, the clinical condition of the patient was improved with the peripheral oxygen saturation of 95%. The creatinine also decreased to 1.1 mg/dL after the end of CRRT and urine output reached to 70 mL/h. No laboratory abnormality was seen during the CRRT. The chest X-ray revealed recovery of both lungs following the completion of 3 sessions of hemopurification (Fig. 1c). Also, the inflammatory cytokines were measured 48 h following the last session of hemoperfusion and showed a remarkable decrease. IL-1, and IL-6 were decreased from 523.3 pg/mL to 38.25 pg/mL, and 226.35 pg/mL to 210.18 pg/mL, respectively. The measurements also showed the decrease in IL-8 from 886.5 pg/mL to 482.4 pg/mL. Tumor necrosis factor alpha level decreased from 49.5 pg/mL to 47.3 pg/mL at the end of 3 sessions of hemoperfusion. The patient was finally transferred to the ward with an acceptable clinical condition."

        "clinical_notes": "A 54-year old man presented to the emergency department of Erfan Niyayesh Hospital, Tehran, Iran, with complains of high-grade fever, cough, and dyspnea for five days. At admission time, he had fever up to 38 ?C. Peripheral oxygen saturation was 90% with a face mask. No abnormality was seen in laboratory results except positive C-reactive protein, lymphopenia with 570 cells/?L, and severe respiratory acidosis. The chest X-ray imaging revealed bilateral infiltration in both upper and lower lobs (Fig. 1a). The patient had no underlying diseases and history of medicine usage. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sample for COVID-19 was reported positive and according to RT-PCR test and clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was made for the patient. The therapeutic regimen included Hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 200 mg P.O. BID and lopinavir/ritonavir at a dose of 200/50 mg P.O. BID initiated for the patient. After four days, the clinical condition of the patient was deteriorated and he was subjected to intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. The peripheral oxygen saturation decreased to 82%. The chest X-ray imaging showed the progressive infiltration (Fig. 1b) and the patient was categorized as a critically COVID-19 case with remarkable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The plasma level of interlukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured at this time. The results showed high levels of inflammatory cytokines. The urine output also decreased to 200 mL during the last 12 h and creatinine increased to 1.5 mg/dL. At this time, it is decided to start continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT, Prismaflex, Baxter, IL, USA) with disposable hemoperfusion cartridge (HA 380 cartridge, Jafron Biomedical Co., China) due to cytokine release storm and hypoxemia. A Shaldon catheter was inserted and CRRT was done for three sessions. The CRRT modality was continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The replacement fluid volume was removed by 35 mL/kg/h and the pump circulated blood by 250 mL/min. Priming of hemoperfusion was done with saline, and the cartridge was primed in a vertical position with the arterial side facing downward. A bolus dose of 2500 IU of heparin was administered into the arterial line, the cartridge was kept inlet side down, and blood flow through the cartridge was begun. Totally, 6000 IU was needed through the procedure. CRRT was started with a high ultrafiltration rate (200 mL/h). Each cartridge was replaced with a new cartridge after 6 h. The fluid removal rate was decreased to 50 mL/h after 8 h and then to zero mL/h during the last 8 h in the first 24 h. The second and the third sessions of CRRT were conducted by 0 mL/h fluid removal. A 24-h rest between sessions, was considered to avoid the probable coagulopathy and electrolyte abnormality.

She developed flu-like symptoms on 24th January 2020 with transient improvement after taking antibiotics and symptomatic treatment prescribed by a general practitioner. However, her fever relapsed on 30th January 2020 with productive cough and dyspnea. She had no history of travel in the preceding month, but she owned a fashion boutique with many mainland Chinese customers owing to its proximity to the West Kowloon high-speed rail station. On admission, she had a fever of 39.6?C with sinus tachycardia of 126 bpm and blood pressure of 198/92 mmHg. She was tachypnoeic with oxygen saturation of 80% in room air. Bilateral crepitations were heard on auscultation and chest X-ray revealed multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates (Figure 2 (a)). In the absence of history of travel to China or contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, she was admitted to ward A in an open cubicle under standard precautions for community-acquired pneumonia (6 ACH, normal pressure setting) at 01:22 h on 2nd February 2020. She could not wear a surgical mask as she was on oxygen therapy through a simple facemask (Soundway?, Ningbo Shengyurui Medical Appliances Co. Ltd, Ningbo, China; Figure 2(b)). She also had frequent coughs while residing in the ward. She became more hypoxic around 18:00 h and required an increase in oxygen therapy to 8 L/min, delivered through the same facemask. On 3rd February 2020, she was transferred to an AIIR at 12:35 h and was electively intubated at 13:00 h for progressive respiratory failure. Nasopharyngeal swab for multiplex PCR FilmArray? RP2 panel (Biofire Diagnostics, bioM?rieux, Marcy-l??toile, France), urine for BinaxNOW Legionella and pneumococcal antigen (Abbott, IL, USA) were negative. The patient was tested for COVID-19 as enhanced laboratory surveillance on 3rd February 2020, where both combined NPA with throat swab, and tracheal aspirate showed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a Ct value of 22.8 and 26.1, respectively. The patient was subsequently transferred to the Infectious Diseases Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital, for further management.(a) Chest-X-ray of index patient on admission showing bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.",

There was no chillness, cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia, chest discomfort, dyspnea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Physical examination disclosed body temperature of 38.1 ?C, blood pressure of 129/68 mm Hg, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Chest radiography (CXR) revealed mild increased infiltration over bilateral lower lung field. Peripheral-blood white-cell count was 3770 per cubic millimeter (with 62.3% neutrophils and 32.1% lymphocytes). Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay performed by the Centers for Diseases Control in Taiwan (Taiwan CDC). On day 6 in hospital, the patient remained febrile, malaise and poor appetite. Follow-up CXR revealed increasing opacity at right middle and lower lung fields (Fig. 1A). Levofloxacin was initiated. On hospital day 12, after a 6-day course of levofloxacin, her fever abated with improved appetite and physical activity. She became free of symptoms afterward.

        "clinical_notes": "A 67-year-old woman with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes and end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis therapy for 4 years received a deceased donor kidney transplant in March 2019. Her eGFR was 45 to 55 ml/min per 1.73 m2. She was maintained on tacrolimus with levels between 5 and 8 ng/ml, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 250 mg twice a day (BD), and prednisolone 5 mg OD. Her other medications included ramipril, aspirin, alfacalcidol, and amiloride. She presented on March 5 with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy consolidation (Figure 1a). SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase chain reaction tests from nose and throat viral swabs were positive. Bronchial washing for pneumocystis polymerase chain reaction was negative, as was blood polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus DNA. There was no other positive microbiological diagnosis. She was hypoxic with peripheral oxygen saturation of 86% and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, so she was transferred to intensive therapy unit (ITU) and commenced noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure for type 1 respiratory failure) and subsequent intubation and ventilation as her clinical condition deteriorated. Serum CRP on admission was 83 mg/l, hemoglobin 110 g/l, with normal total white cell count, and mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.8 ? 109/l). She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. No specific antiviral drugs were given. MMF was ceased. Low-dose tacrolimus was initially continued but stopped 1 day before death. On day 3 post admission, she developed acute kidney injury (AKI), with a serum creatinine increase to 225 ?mol/l. She remained stable on the ventilator with reducing oxygen requirements and improvement in lung infiltrates on chest X-ray (Figure 1b) but deteriorated markedly on March 16 with high serum lactate and lactate dehydrogenase levels and an acute rise of CRP to 190. She developed severe metabolic acidosis resistant to correction on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, probably owing to an intra-abdominal event (bowel infarction and/or intra-abdominal sepsis). She deteriorated rapidly and died on March 17. (a) on admission showing bilateral patchy consolidation"

        "clinical_notes": "A 67-year-old woman with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes and end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis therapy for 4 years received a deceased donor kidney transplant in March 2019. Her eGFR was 45 to 55 ml/min per 1.73 m2. She was maintained on tacrolimus with levels between 5 and 8 ng/ml, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 250 mg twice a day (BD), and prednisolone 5 mg OD. Her other medications included ramipril, aspirin, alfacalcidol, and amiloride. She presented on March 5 with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy consolidation (Figure 1a). SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase chain reaction tests from nose and throat viral swabs were positive. Bronchial washing for pneumocystis polymerase chain reaction was negative, as was blood polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus DNA. There was no other positive microbiological diagnosis. She was hypoxic with peripheral oxygen saturation of 86% and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, so she was transferred to intensive therapy unit (ITU) and commenced noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure for type 1 respiratory failure) and subsequent intubation and ventilation as her clinical condition deteriorated. Serum CRP on admission was 83 mg/l, hemoglobin 110 g/l, with normal total white cell count, and mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.8 ? 109/l). She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. No specific antiviral drugs were given. MMF was ceased. Low-dose tacrolimus was initially continued but stopped 1 day before death. On day 3 post admission, she developed acute kidney injury (AKI), with a serum creatinine increase to 225 ?mol/l. She remained stable on the ventilator with reducing oxygen requirements and improvement in lung infiltrates on chest X-ray (Figure 1b) but deteriorated markedly on March 16 with high serum lactate and lactate dehydrogenase levels and an acute rise of CRP to 190. She developed severe metabolic acidosis resistant to correction on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, probably owing to an intra-abdominal event (bowel infarction and/or intra-abdominal sepsis). She deteriorated rapidly and died on March 17. (b) 8 days later showing improvement in lung infiltrates."

        "clinical_notes": "On 12th March 2020 a 78-year-old woman was admitted to our Emergency Department for ongoing myoclonic jerks of the right face and right limbs. She suffered from hypertension and postencephalitic epilepsy. When she was 76, the patient developed a Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. The initial presentation of the herpetic encephalitis were repetitive oral buccal automatisms and aphasia lasting 6 h associated with the electroencephalographic findings of subcontinuous epileptiform discharges over the left temporal fields, configuring a non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). The status epilepticus was successfully treated with a sequence of antiepileptic drugs. Because of the encephalitis, fluent aphasia and mild right limbs weakness persisted, with only a partial recovery after neuro-rehabilitation. Since then, the patient was steadily under treatment with valproic acid and levetiracetam and remained seizure-free for more than two years. She was under regular neurologic follow-up and the last electroencephalogram performed ten days prior to admission was normal (Fig. 1, label A). In the morning of 12th March 2020, the patient developed a focal status epilepticus without any prodromal symptoms. First Aid evaluation showed alert, eupnoeic patient with normal body temperature (36.1 ?C). The neurological examination showed fluent aphasia, right central facial nerve palsy, pronation of the right arm and drift of the right leg. The patient displayed ongoing myoclonic jerks of the right eyelid and upper-lip, started two hours before. She was treated with intravenous valproic acid, followed by intravenous midazolam for the persistence of subintrant focal seizures. The electroencephalogram revealed semi-rhythmic, irregular, high amplitude delta activity, predominantly lateralized over the left fronto-centro-temporal regions, consistent with focal status epilepticus (Fig. 1, labels B and C). The antiepileptic treatment resolved the status epilepticus (Fig. 1, label D). Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain was negative for acute lesions. Brain MRI confirmed extensive gliosis and atrophy involving the left temporo-parietal lobe, in the absence of new cerebral lesions as documented by both diffusion weighted imaging and post-gadolinium sequences (Fig. 2, labels A?D). The chest X-ray was unremarkable (Fig. 2, label E). Laboratory analysis revealed lymphocytopenia (560 cells/mm3) and thrombocytopenia (125,000/mm3). Twelve hours after the admission to the Emergency Room, the patient developed fever. She did not exhibit respiratory symptoms, such as cough or dyspnoea. Her blood oxygenation was normal. The blood analysis showed a further decrease in the white cells and platelets count. The C-reactive protein was 29.7 mg/L, procalcitonine was 0.07 ng/mL. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, her fever did not improve. Blood cultures and urine culture were negative for common bacteria, fungi and neurotropic viruses. The epidemiological survey revealed that in the previous week the patient met her son, who went into preventive isolation afterwards for being in contact with three people with a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs specimen of the patient were then obtained and Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed, which tested positive for SARS-CoV2. The patient was transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit and treated with lopinavir-ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine. After initiation of the treatment, the clinical conditions of the patient improved, with resolution of the fever. A further chest X-ray (Fig. 2, label F) and a lung ultrasound were negative for interstitial pneumonia. Since then, no other seizures occurred. During the hospitalization, she did not require oxygen therapy. On 28th March she was discharged in stable condition, afebrile after two negative swabs for SARS-CoV-2. (E) Chest X-ray performed upon arrival to the Emergency Room"

        "clinical_notes": "Initial admission chest X-ray shows increased and thickened right lower lung markings, suggesting bronchitis and interstitial pneumonia. On February 4, 2020, a 50-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of ?fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia,? and she was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Fever Clinic of Xiangyang First People?s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College. The patient had a five-day business trip in Wuhan (from January 22, 2020, to January 27, 2020). Fever initially occurred on January 28, 2020, with a body temperature of 38.5?C, with dry cough and muscle ache. On January 30, 2020, the patient went to Xiangyang First People?s Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for consultation in the respiratory department, and the laboratory test reported that the influenza A virus serology was negative. The results of blood routine examination were normal [white blood cell count (WBC): 5.1?109/l; neutrophil percentage (neu%): 69.2%; lymphocyte percentage (lym%): 25.6%; lymphocyte absolute value (lym): 1.28?109/l; C-reactive protein (CRP): 6.1 mg/l] and she was given Tamiflu (75 mg/time, twice per day) orally and was rehydrated. Three days later (on February 2, 2020), the patient still had dry cough, so she went to hospital (TCM) again. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip and a novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was performed and it was negative. At admission, chest X-ray showed increased and thickened right lower lung markings, which suggested bronchitis and possible interstitial pneumonia according to her positive family history of interstitial pneumonia (Figure 1). Levofloxacin was given drip once for intravenous treatment, and Tamiflu was continued to be taken orally. On February 04, 2020, the patient's symptoms were still not improved, and her body temperature continued to rise to 39.2?C. She was referred to our fever clinic for further evaluation, and a chest computed tomography (CT) was performed. Chest CT showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis (Figure 2a, 2b), and the subsequent 2019-nCoV pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive."

No visible pleural effusions.. This case illustrates and shows the most common findings of influenza A pneumonia a combination of multifocal ground-glass opacities (GGO) and irregular consolidations, mainly along and around the bronchovascular bundles.. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after respiratory swab was positive for influenza A virus RNA.. The patient was put under isolation and received supportive and antiviral therapy (oseltamivir) and an antibiotic regimen covering for gram-positive cocci for 7 days. After a hospital course of 8 days, the patient recovered and was released home in a vastly improved condition.. Outpatient follow-up CT, three weeks later, was normal and showed complete resolution of the ground glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations.. This is also an important differential diagnosis for COVID-19 pneumonia.",

There is hazy opacity in the right lower zone medially and the right heart border is not visualized.  This could be misinterpreted as an additional right middle lobe consolidation, however this is in fact due to a pectus excavatum deformity, which is suggested by the orientation of the ribs and is confirmed on the lateral film. .

Follow-up imaging two weeks later shows resolution of the left upper lobe pneumonia, but persistence of the hazy opacity in the right lower zone medially which is related to pectus excavatum deformity.. Discussion: This case demonstrates the typical appearance of pectus excavatum on frontal chest radiographs and how one might be tempted to incorrectly report right middle lobe pathology especially in the setting of respiratory tract symptoms.",
